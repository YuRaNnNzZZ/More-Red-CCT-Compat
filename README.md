# More Red x CC:Tweaked Compat
This is a simple mod bridging **More Red**'s bundled network cables and **CC:Tweaked**'s bundled redstone API.  

By default computers do not connect to bundled network cables and cannot retrieve color value of adjacent network cables

This mod fixes that and provides computers with ability to read/write network cable signals directly (by acting as a bundled network cable itself)

It works with any More Red block that exposes channeled power capability (such as Bundled Cable Relay Plates)

More Red signal colors correspond with CC:Tweaked's [colors API](https://tweaked.cc/module/colors.html) values (so `colors.red` is a red channel, `colors.green` is green channel, etc.)  
To output signal on multiple color channels use the [color.combine](https://tweaked.cc/module/colors.html#v:combine) function.

**Both [More Red](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/more-red) and [CC:Tweaked](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked) are required for this mod to work.**  
CC:Tweaked 1.108.0 for 1.20.1 adds native More Red integration, making this mod obsolete for that vesrion.
