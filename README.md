# This is a simple mod bridging **More Red**'s bundled network cables and **CC:Tweaked**'s bundled redstone API.

### By default computers do not connect to bundled network cables and cannot retrieve color value of adjacent network cables

### This mod fixes that and provides computers with ability to read/write network cable signals directly (by acting as a bundled network cable itself)

### It works with any More Red block that exposes channeled power capability (such as Bundled Cable Relay Plates)

### More Red signal colors correspond with CC:Tweaked's [colors API](https://tweaked.cc/module/colors.html) values (so `colors.red` is a red channel, `colors.green` is green channel, etc.)
### To output signal on multiple color channels use the [color.combine](https://tweaked.cc/module/colors.html#v:combine) function.

## **Both [More Red](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/more-red) and [CC:Tweaked](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked) are required for this mod to work.**
